## Session Summary: Zama Quiz App - Beginner Mode Revision & Business Value Questions

### Project Location
`/Users/eliastazartes/code/zama/zama-quiz-app`

### Tech Stack
React 19 + TypeScript + Vite 7 + Tailwind CSS 4 + Supabase

### What Was Done This Session

#### 1. **Beginner Questions Complete Rewrite**
Rewrote all beginner questions based on user feedback. Key corrections:
- **fhEVM is a Solidity library**, NOT a modified EVM or separate blockchain
- Removed gaming as a use case (not a primary Zama focus)
- Fixed technical inaccuracies (balances stored off-chain with handles on-chain, not "encrypted on-chain")
- Balanced answer option lengths so correct answer isn't obvious

**Questions updated in `src/data/questions.ts`:**
- B005: Bootstrapping - answer now "Resets noise to a low level", explanation mentions PBS/ciphertext refreshing
- B008: fhEVM - now asks "What does the fhEVM library do?" with GitHub description
- B015: Confidential transfers - focuses on FHE operations, not storage architecture
- Removed B013 (ebool comparison) and B014 (logging handles) as too technical

**Current beginner question count: 18** (down from 20 after removals)

#### 2. **UX Improvements**
- **Text selection**: Questions, answers, and explanations now selectable (changed buttons to divs with `select-text`)
- **Question nav colors**: Shows green/red immediately after answering (not just in review mode)
- **Navigation fix**: "Next" button now jumps to next unanswered question (was stuck before)
- **Env flag for beginner mode**: `VITE_ENABLE_BEGINNER_MODE=true` in `.env.local` enables locally; hidden in prod

#### 3. **Files Modified**
- `src/data/questions.ts` - Beginner questions rewritten
- `src/components/WelcomeScreen.tsx` - Mode selector controlled by env var
- `src/components/QuestionCard.tsx` - Text selection enabled
- `src/components/QuestionNav.tsx` - Immediate correct/wrong colors
- `src/components/NavigationButtons.tsx` - "Next" jumps to next unanswered
- `src/App.tsx` - Pass new props to NavigationButtons
- `.env.local` - Created with `VITE_ENABLE_BEGINNER_MODE=true` (gitignored)
- `agents.md` - Added GitHub issues check, fhEVM clarifications
- `PLAN-easy-mode.md` - Updated with correct fhEVM definition

### Current Task: Business Value Questions for Advanced Quiz

**Context**: Jason (Zama's ecosystem/business dev lead) wants questions ensuring Zama devs who don't know blockchain/crypto understand:
- WHY Zama protocol exists
- WHY privacy matters for mainstream adoption
- What differentiates Zama from Aztec, Canton, Zcash
- The business value proposition

**Source Material**: Video transcript in `video-transcript/bankless/` folder:
- `summary.txt` - Structured summary of Bankless interview with Rand Hindi (Zama founder)
- `NoteGPT_TRANSCRIPT_1767791422994.txt` - Full transcript

**Key Talking Points Identified**:

1. **Why Privacy is Essential**
   - "Show your bank account to anyone on the street - that's blockchain today"
   - Institutional adoption blocked without confidentiality
   - HTTPS analogy: HTTP→HTTPS transition, same will happen for blockchain

2. **Cryptography Trade-offs**
   - ZK: Good for scaling/proofs, lacks composability
   - MPC: Doesn't scale
   - FHE: Computation on encrypted data, enables composability
   - Zama uses all three: FHE for compute, MPC for decryption, ZK for integrity

3. **Zama's Unique Value**
   - Layer ON TOP of existing chains (not a new chain)
   - No bridging - shield/unshield directly on Ethereum
   - Preserves composability and liquidity
   - Devs write Solidity, users use existing wallets

4. **Trust Model**
   - 13 reputable operators (Ledger, Fireblocks, etc.)
   - 2/3 majority for decryption
   - Hardware enclaves, geographic distribution
   - Analogy: Internet DNS runs on 13 root servers too

5. **Competitive Differentiation**
   - Aztec: ZK L2, requires bridging, breaks composability
   - Zcash: Requires buying different asset, no composability
   - Zama: Native layer, same chain, full composability

**Proposed Question Categories**:
1. Why Privacy Matters (2-3 questions)
2. Cryptography Trade-offs (2-3 questions)
3. Zama Architecture Choices (2-3 questions)
4. Competitive Landscape (1-2 questions)
5. Business Applications (2-3 questions)

### What To Do Next

1. **Get user approval** on proposed question categories/structure
2. **Draft 10-15 business value questions** for advanced quiz
3. **Add to `src/data/questions.ts`** in a new section (maybe "Business & Value Proposition")
4. **Update `advancedSections` export** to include new section
5. **Test and commit**

### Important Constraints
- **DO NOT enable beginner mode in prod** without explicit user approval
- Questions should teach non-crypto Zama devs WHY the protocol matters
- Avoid overly technical answers - focus on business value and differentiation
- All answer options should be similar length/detail level

### Commands
```bash
cd /Users/eliastazartes/code/zama/zama-quiz-app
npm run dev          # Dev server with beginner mode enabled via .env.local
npm run build        # Prod build (beginner mode hidden)
git push             # Auto-deploys to Netlify
```

### Git Status
All changes from this session have been committed and pushed. Ready to start business value questions.

## Session 2: Business & Value Proposition Quiz Mode

### What Was Done

#### 1. **Created Business Quiz Mode (6 Questions)**

Added a separate "Business" quiz mode with questions crafted collaboratively. Each question went through multiple drafts to ensure:
- All answer options are plausible (no obvious wrong answers)
- Questions teach insights, not just test trivia
- Tone is educational, not marketing
- Sources verified against transcript/whitepaper

**Questions added (BV01-BV06):**

| ID | Topic | Key Insight |
|----|-------|-------------|
| BV01 | Why privacy didn't exist | Tech wasn't ready (FHE too slow until recently) |
| BV02 | ZK vs FHE | ZK proves statements; FHE computes on encrypted data |
| BV03 | Trust assumptions | 13 operators, 9 to collude; L2Beat-style trust analysis |
| BV04 | Institutional blocker | Transparent ledgers incompatible with finance |
| BV05 | Programmable compliance | Recreate traditional finance model (you see, bank sees, neighbor doesn't) |
| BV06 | HTTPS adoption pattern | Defaults, incentives, penalties, ecosystem lock-in |

#### 2. **Three Quiz Modes Now Available**

Updated app to support three separate quiz modes:
- **Advanced** (default): 35 questions on internal architecture
- **Beginner**: 18 questions on FHE basics
- **Business**: 6 questions on value proposition

**Files changed:**
- `src/types/quiz.ts` - Added `'business'` to Difficulty type
- `src/data/questions.ts` - Added businessSections export, 6 new questions with `difficulty: "business"`
- `src/components/WelcomeScreen.tsx` - Refactored to show all 3 modes with config object
- `src/components/Leaderboard.tsx` - Added Business tab (3 tabs total)
- `src/App.tsx` - Updated modeLabel/modeColor for business mode
- `src/components/Results.tsx` - Fixed sections for business mode

#### 3. **"Suggest a Question" CTA**

Added button on results page that opens a GitHub issue template for users to suggest new questions.

**New file:** `src/components/SuggestQuestionButton.tsx`

**To review suggestions:**
```bash
gh issue list --repo Eikix/zama-quiz --label question-suggestion
gh issue view <issue-number> --repo Eikix/zama-quiz
```

### Question Crafting Guidelines Learned

1. **All options must be plausible** - If one option says "should never be compromised" or is nonsensical, it's a giveaway
2. **Test insights, not trivia** - "What's wrong with this statement?" > "What year did X happen?"
3. **Use real quotes as inspiration** - Rand's talking points, but adapted for learning
4. **Verify claims** - Checked whitepaper for "hundreds of nodes" claim before including
5. **Avoid marketing tone** - Factual, not "Zama is great because..."
6. **Consider audience** - Devs who may think 1 operator is fine; 13 is already distributed to them

### Key Talking Points from Bankless Interview (Rand Hindi)

**Direct quotes used:**
- "Go to anyone on the street and ask them to show you their bank account. That's blockchain today."
- "The only downside of ZK is that you cannot compute on the ZK proof. You cannot stake that proof."
- "There are 13 companies responsible for this. So the internet runs on 13 companies... and it works."

**Insights incorporated:**
- Privacy was a tech constraint, not missing demand (SMS → Signal analogy)
- ZK proofs are endpoints, not inputs for further computation
- Trust assumptions aren't binary; L2Beat evaluates this seriously
- Institutions blocked by transparency, not speed/cost
- Programmable compliance = traditional finance model on-chain
- HTTPS won through infrastructure defaults, not user demand

### Supabase Leaderboard

No schema changes needed. The `mode` column already exists (TEXT type) and accepts any value. Business quiz scores will work immediately with `mode: 'business'`.

**If questions are added later:** Percentage-based ranking already handles different totals. No action needed unless strict version comparability is desired.

### Commits Made

1. `feat: add Business & Value Proposition quiz mode with 6 questions`
2. `feat: add 'Suggest a Question' CTA on results page`

### What To Do Next

1. **Add more business questions** - Currently only 6, could expand to 10-15
2. **Enable beginner mode in prod** - Still hidden behind env flag
3. **Review user-submitted question suggestions** via GitHub issues
4. **Consider question versioning** - If strict leaderboard comparability becomes important

### Commands
```bash
cd /Users/eliastazartes/code/zama/zama-quiz-app
npm run dev          # Dev server
npm run build        # Prod build
git push             # Auto-deploys to Netlify

# Review question suggestions
gh issue list --repo Eikix/zama-quiz --label question-suggestion
```
